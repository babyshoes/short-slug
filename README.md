# slug.ly

An app for converting a long URL into a slugly little short one (generated randomly or custom). Aggregates stats on visits.

With a length of 6 and permissible characters only in the alphanumeric range, we have nearly 20 million possible permutations. To extend this and avoid risk of collision (currently handled rote), we can make the length elastic and permit special characters.
